## Bingo

This is a simple client-side javascript implementation of a British style Bingo game.

## Players

[Bingo Cards for Players](https://biinari.github.io/bingo/)

Play along by tapping / clicking on numbers to mark them as called. Or you can print out a page of bingo tickets to play on paper.

Currently, 6 bingo tickets are generated when loading this page. Unlike paper tickets, these 6 tickets are not related to each other so they do not cover the whole set of numbers between them. Some numbers may well appear on multiple tickets, and some numbers may not appear on any of the tickets on the page.

## Caller

[Generator for the Bingo Caller](https://biinari.github.io/bingo/caller/)

* Randomly chooses numbers from 1-90.
* Gives the caller a typical bingo call to go with that number.
* Keeps a history of the most recent 5 calls (in case you are asked to repeat a recent number).
* Tracks all called numbers in a table.

Note: some traditional British Bingo calls are quite rude so have been replaced by child-friendly alternatives.
