## Bingo

This is a simple client-side javascript implementation of a British style Bingo game.

[Players](https://biinari.github.io/bingo/) - play along by tapping / clicking on numbers to mark them as called. Or you can print out a page of bingo tickets to play on paper.

[Caller](https://biinari.github.io/bingo/caller/) - Randomly chooses numbers from 1-90 and gives the caller a typical bingo call to go with that number. Note: some traditional British Bingo calls are quite rude so have been replaced by child-friendly alternatives.
